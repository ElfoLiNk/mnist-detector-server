# MNIST Detector Server
An example of how to use a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)
trained on [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).   
Feel free to fork and contribute!

## Project Description
This repository aims to be an easy and well documented example on how to use a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)
trained with the help of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)'s distributed computation.   
It uses [Deeplearning4j](http://deeplearning4j.org/) on top of [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/).   
The Neural Network was trained against digit classifications from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data set,
a subset of a larger set available from [NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)](http://www.nist.gov/).   

## Lineage
This example is a fork of [a similar example](https://github.com/sugyan/tensorflow-mnist) trained with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
